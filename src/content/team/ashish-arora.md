description: "Growing up in Dehradun, a town full of mystery, stories and nature, the visual medium for Ashish was a natural extension of his very being. He is always ideating and is known for not resting until he converts that idea into a tangible creation. He has dabbled in photography for over half a decade, and has had some of his work displayed at the Indian Habitat Centre, Delhi."
