description: "An eye for beauty in everyday mundane mixed with an incessant love for aesthetics, Gurpreet spends her time curating all things design and creative. She also speaks the language of UI/UX and front-end development. On some days, you'll find her behind a camera's lens and on some, baking a fine batch of chocolate brownies. "
