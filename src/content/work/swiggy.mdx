        ## Pushing the vertical bar
        
        Inventia is a well known name in the pharmaceutical world, with clientele across the globe. After huge success in the pharma space, they decided to venture into the nutraceutical space. With a detailed product line and marketing plan in place, we were brought on board to develop a creative direction for this new brand. Taking a cue from the parent company, we created a visual language that was a fresher and more relevant extension of the parent identity.

    ## Time fries when you’re having fun

    We were commissioned by Swiggy to create a digital campaign to communicate these key positioning statements and engage consumers. Our aim was to make Swiggy synonymous with food. The best way to create this level of lasting mental association was to engage the customers senses. We decided to do this visually, creating a series of animated banner ads depicting mouth-watering food and unlocking the customer's imagination using situational comedy.

    ## Strike through hunger

    Here are some of the illustrations that were designed for the Swiggy explainer video which was used while launching the app on play store. We chose to experiment with the usage of a single line for the screen designs. It gives the animations a clean, modest and elegant style.
