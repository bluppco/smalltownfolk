        ## Triggering an understanding 
        
        Societal Platform creates a shared infrastructure that lets every actor in a society participate in social innovation. It isn't the easiest concept to grasp at first glance. The theories around co creation, collaboration and power of networks would often excite social and governmental bodies around the world.

        For example, a few countries in South America were excited by the concept but needed more clarity on how it could be applied in the real world. Societal Platform reached out to us to bridge this communication gap.

    ## Melding empathy and cognizance

    We realised, quiet early, that in order for them to truly understand Societal Platform, there has to be a give and take. We needed to start a conversation. Using functional design and gamification, we suggested the use of trigger cards.

    We used the education system as a case study and created trigger cards that were divided into three sets - problem, solution and concept cards. The participants were asked to draw problem cards, understand them and then match them to the appropriate solution card. This allowed them to understand how to mix and match problems with solutions using empathy. Once the matches had been made, the concept behind this instinctive choice was explained by the concept cards.

    ## Breaking the language barrier

    We then decided to take the cards one step further and cross the language barrier. We created the same trigger card deck in local languages so people who'd understood the concept could then go on and educate others in their country.
