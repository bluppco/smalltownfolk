        ## Branding a partnership  
        
        The nutraceutical market is one of the fastest growing industries in the economy right now. Mergers and acquisitions make branding and product differentiation an important need in the industry. Omniactive was no different. 

        After a recent acquisition of a core extracts firm called 'Indfrag', Omniactive reached out to help plan the next phase for their brand's journey. They reached out to us to help them with the next phase of their brand's journey and to develop a rebranding strategy. After a few detailed discussions and workshops, we restructured the brand architecture and streamlined their various offerings. These offerings were split into three new verticals which lead to creating fresh identities for each. The visual identities were created bearing in mind the identity of the parent brand and the unique functionalities of the verticals - Xtracts, Olixr and Ogments.

    ## On the right Xtracs

    'Xtracs' was created using the phonetics for the word 'Extracts'. We wanted to convey the range of herbal extracts on offer with a sharp and simple name. Xtracts is powerful and to the point. It sparks a direct mental connect to the industry. When creating the logo we expanded the Omniactive brand identity, especially their brand colours and design elements.

    ## Olixr of life

    The name 'Olixr' comes from Elixir. In folklore, the elixir of life was an alchemic preparation believed to be capable of prolonging life. The name and the meaning hold great significance as we are talking about the neutraceutical industry. We used a minimalist typography style and created mnemonic that became the hero. The mnemonic adds in to establish the botanical product line and carries a crisp tone to it.

    ## Ogments to reality

    The name 'Ogments' is derived from the word 'augment' which means to enhance. This name is a direct play on the augmented range of herbal extracts in powder form. The name is easy to say and links directly to the overall use of the products in this vertical. The brand colours and the 'O' were extended to create the design identity of this vertical.

    ## Visuals and Branding

    As we created a renewed visual language for Omniactive, we decided to use solid colours and typography as a key strength. We decided to play with the all the brand colours, using negative space and selective shading usage to ensure that the design was clean yet strong.
