        ## Pushing the vertical bar
        
        Inventia is a well known name in the pharmaceutical world, with clientele across the globe. After huge success in the pharma space, they decided to venture into the nutraceutical space. With a detailed product line and marketing plan in place, we were brought on board to develop a creative direction for this new brand. Taking a cue from the parent company, we created a visual language that was a fresher and more relevant extension of the parent identity.

    ## Consistency is key

    For an organisation that was making its first attempt to have a consistent visual language, the brand manual acted as a guiding force. Using a clean style inspired from the colours of the parent brand, we used flat illustrations and visual aids to create a consistent visual language. The manual went delved into specifics relating to visual extensions, colour systems, typography and product logo usage in such a way that it allowed teams across departments and regions to follow a consistent tone and visual style for all their communication pieces

    ## Pushing posts and limits

    We worked with the team to crack a social media strategy and outreach program for the new products. As part of this we created various linkedin ads and posts that allowed Inventia to reach its desired audience and generate new leads.
