    ## Circling back

    The first facet of the project was to create a consistent visual language to help achieve their business goals. We began by exploring the infogain brandmark. The circle stood out as an easily amenable design element. The circle was further developed into various forms. Each of these form visually represents a personality trait of the brand.

    ## A well rounded visual language

    Using the circle as the base we chalked out a complete visual language over the course of the next few months. The complete work was complied in an exhaustive brand manual. The manual was designed to be actionable and to transcend mediums and geographies.
