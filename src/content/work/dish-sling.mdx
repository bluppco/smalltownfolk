        Many organisations have become truly global in their operations to enable higher efficiencies and serve their customers better. This is possible because of digital transformation, but it’s easier said than done. Bringing in engineering practices that are the global standard isn’t just about adopting the latest practices in tech. It’s about bringing in a cultural change, a new way of thinking and approaching problems. The leadership at Dish was committed to driving this change and creating a world class engineering organisation. We were brought in to create a unified communication and design strategy to kick off and sustain this transformation program.

        ## Soaring towards change

       This change management program was coined 'Falcon', since speed and precision were to be the hallmark of the transformation.

       The Falcon speaks about victory, success and a strong vision. Rising above challenging situations, being analytical and thinking strategically, the Falcon observes and considers the best way to reach its destination.

       This identity was created to initiate the change management journey at Dish and Sling TV across the globe. The idea was to showcase a global engineering team that worked with speed and precision. This translated to fast & fluid and dictated our design style. The visual language has two core elements - circles and pacing lines. The circles are a representation of the team being global in nature; the lines represent movement - denoting speed & efficiency.

        ## A bird's eye view

        Our first move was to create a bedrock for this transformational journey; a set of guiding principles that drove this push to change. Posters were designed to share these core values, each of which had a direct tie in to the larger transformation strategy.

        ## Building anticipation

       Before the entire program was launched, we needed to generate curiosity and interest in everyone's minds. The best way to do this was to create fun teasers that left people giggling and wondering what was next. We used hints of wit to get everyone acquainted with the idea of change.

        ## Keeping our eyes turned skyward

        We used mailers as a medium to spread information and keep spirits up across the organisation. It began with awareness building campaigns like The Plastic Free Office and Power Conservation Campaigns that grew out of the overall falcon initiative. The mailers grew to include employee engagement and relevant updates in the company. During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, we sent out mailers to all employees working from home to improve moral and create a sense of community while remaining socially distant.
