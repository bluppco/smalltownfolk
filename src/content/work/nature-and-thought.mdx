        ## Ushering in thought to the supplement industry 
        
        The renewed popularity of natural products has caused the entry of an array of supplement companies into the Indian market. Many of these companies lack a scientific approach to health, resulting in confusion and mistrust among the consumer. Nature & Thought (N&T) wanted to change that thought by creating products that were fuelled by science. They reached out to us to help bring this brand to life.

        ## Putting together a train of thought 
        
        From our brand discovery sessions, we realized that deliberate thinking was a major part of N&T’s ethos. They carried a strong belief that the right science can make a huge impact in the lives of their customers. That deliberate thinking combined with the vision of bringing nature’s benefits to the customers led us to the name ‘Nature & Thought’.

        ## A natural design system
        
       The interplay between ‘thought’ & ‘nature’ was central to the visual language. Our colour systems combined rich, earthy, deep tones with calm, friendly tones to create a visual contrast to evoke emotion among our customers.

        ## Creating a packaging system for scalability 
        
       We created a packaging system that combined brand & functional messaging with a clearly defined information hierarchy. The system was thought out to make sure N&T could roll out additional products in a short time period.

        ## A delightful influencer kit
        
       The influencer kit was in line with the overall brand, packing tiny delights into a wholesome brand experience. The main idea was of ‘reuse’ and the items included were in line with that thought.
