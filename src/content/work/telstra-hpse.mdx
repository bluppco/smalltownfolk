        ## Reimagining the power of internal brands 
        
        Telstra, one of Australia’s leading telecommunication and technology firms, wanted to introduce new ways of working in the future. HPSE (High Performing Software Engineering) was created to lead this digital transformation journey. As HPSE became the fastest growing vertical at Telstra, it became imperative to project a unified vision to work towards. This proved to be harder than it looked. That's where we came in. We were tasked with creating a compelling brand story that could drive everyone towards a common goal - a collective behavioural push towards cohesion.

        ## The movement towards cohesion
        
        We immediately zeroed in on the fact that the HPSE brand deserved an identity that delineated activity. It is agile. It is disruptive. The true essence of HPSE was one of being in constant motion. HPSE regularly directed efforts through a minefield of ever-changing consumer mindsets. Our use of vibrant colours, arrows, and typography intended to give a sense of constant and cohesive action.

        ## Pushing speed and agility
        
        Working with teams from different parts of the world we wanted a relatable analogy to bridge the cultural gap. Sports, we soon agreed, was the best option. It is a core tenant of Australia's culture and was highly relatable. The posters were designed to communicate the tactics and strategies of this new brand - HPSE using a core narrative of speed and agility. The sports allegory pushed the message of a team with members who enable each other to strive and succeed.

        ## Unfurling Unconference
        
        In the spirit of co-creation and collaboration, we worked on an event that was both fun and informative. Keeping in mind the Telstra community, we decided that a hackathon was the perfect event to cater to HPSE's needs. Coupling it with interactive seminars and workshops on industry-related topics, we had a perfectly collaborative peer-to-peer exchange of learning and information. 

        For Unconference, we created a visual extension that would tie all the event collaterals together. We used flat illustrations with elements of technology to blend the world of tech with loads of fun.
