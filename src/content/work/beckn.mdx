        ## Getting the internet back to its roots
        The world today walks around with interconnectedness in its pockets. We have access to unlimited resources, yet we function in silos. The initial simplicity of the internet and the email got lost to a world of closed ecosystems. beckn believed a simple solution to this complex problem was to get these silos connected to each other.

        beckn is an e-commerce protocol that eases the lives of its 3 main audiences - businesses, governments and individuals, by connecting them to each other. The team reached out to us to create an overall branding strategy to bring this powerful idea to life. They reached out to us to help build this brand story. We worked with them to create the overall brand strategy, positioning and visual language.

    ## Carving out the positioning
    An abstract idea like this needed intense collaboration. We worked as a tight knight team during the discovery phase and led quite a few workshops & discussions with their team. This allowed us to pen down strong values for the brand and a clear positioning.

    ## Hailing a brand identity
    During our collaborative sessions, two things stood out; we wanted the identity to convey the concept of ‘beckoning’ or ‘hailing’ and for it to be universal. In its purest form, beckn would provide the ability to ‘access anything, at any time’ or in simple terms give us the ability to ‘beckn’ anything. It also enables interoperability across operating systems and apps, making it universal.

    We combined these 2 concepts through the use of another universal language that made integration across platforms and technologies possible – ASCII codes. The ASCII characters of ‘.’ and ‘/’ when put together give the visual of a person with a hand raised; signaling something over. The logo was created by extending this basic thought and transforming the letter ‘k’ in beckn. The clean approach to the identity and the tapering gradation illustrates beckn’s idea of leaving a minimal footprint.
