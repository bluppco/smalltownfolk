           R_description="Amintiri is a patisserie established in Bangalore. We were tasked with creating a visual identity and brand personality for them. We centred the brand story around celebration and stories. Creating the logo using minimal typography we extended the same brand personality by using plush shades and gilded accents. The colour schemes, imagery guidelines and photography direction were specifically chosen to exude the same richness and style. Over the time spent during our association with the brand we worked on various projects including Amintiri's online presence, packaging, retail design."

It talks about the brand's philosophy and allows the reader to step into the world of Amintiri. The book uses the language of storytelling to talk about Amintiri's use of traditional baking techniques, historic recipes and and high-quality ingredients. Add that to some enticing photography and you've got a understandably enviable coffee table book."]}
