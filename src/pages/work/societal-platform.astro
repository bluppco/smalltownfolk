           R_description="Societal Platform creates a shared infrastructure that lets every actor in a society participate in social innovation. At its core, Societal Platform helps share social innovations and solutions to larger audiences who have similar problems and resources. Once the actors involved have a broad understanding of the concept the next step is implementation. This is where the design principles came into play. These principles are spread across data, technology, program management, network etc, and act as the ultimate guide to imbibe the philosophies of a societal platform. As the actors involved come from different backgrounds and industries, we decided to use illustrations and visual aids to help get these concepts across. Keeping the new brand language in line, we used rich colours and strong fonts in a meaningful and impactful way. "

                text="Data in isolation consists of bits and bytes. When one views data is relation to humans, it unlocks a whole world of possibilities. We wanted to capture this world in the form of a visual illustration. We designed the cover to portray the larger than life impact of the human element with regard to data using flat fill illustrations and a pictorial representation of data."

The same goes for technology, we seldom appreciate the power that it holds. We designed the cover to showcase the historic and social significance of technology using a museum exhibit as a metaphor."
