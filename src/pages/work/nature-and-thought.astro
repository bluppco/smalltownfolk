           R_description="The renewed popularity of natural products has caused the entry of an array of supplement companies into the Indian market. Many of these companies lack a scientific approach to health, resulting in confusion and mistrust among the consumer. Nature & Thought (N&T) wanted to change that thought by creating products that were fuelled by science. They reached out to us to help bring this brand to life."

They carried a strong belief that the right science can make a huge impact in the lives of their customers. That deliberate thinking combined with the vision of bringing nature’s benefits to the customers led us to the name ‘Nature & Thought’."
